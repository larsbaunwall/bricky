## Meet Bricky - a Haystack conversational bot (Next.js chatbot frontend)

I'm proudly adopted from the [Langchain chatbot sample](https://blog.langchain.dev/langchain-chat/), originally built by [Zahid](https://twitter.com/chillzaza_) - you should go check that repo out too!

## Getting started 🚀

1. Clone this repo!
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Run the development server: `npm run dev`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/chat](http://localhost:3000/api/chat). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/chat.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
